# Four-bar-linkage
In the study of mechanisms, a four-bar linkage, also called a four-bar, is the simplest closed-chain movable linkage. It consists of four bodies, called bars or links, connected in a loop by four joints. Generally, the joints are configured so the links move in parallel planes, and the assembly is called a planar four-bar linkage. Spherical and spatial four-bar linkages also exist and are used in practice [1].

 This CODES are organized to represent the analysis of the mentioned mechanism, wherein the flexible behavior of its components is considered. The Equation of Motion is extended, and results are obtained with Greenwood and Augmented methods.
 
 # Results
 
 Coordinate of the 2nd link is demonstrated in the following illustration.
